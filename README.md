CORE JAVA

<p>first we download the JDK from the Java Oracle website :<a href="https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java21"> </p>
<p> to check whether Java is installed in the system proper, Open CMD and check with command : java --version </p>
<p>if it not then we need to set path , in the system environment </p>

<p>In VS code , open terminal and check with command: javac --version <p>

<p>If we want to check the result quickly , we can check it in <h3>Jshell</h3></p>
<p>for Jshell , open the Window Terminal and Type jshell</p>
